# Tap Them / Bubblewrap

A simple game aimed at toddlers.

## Ideas

- Replace the current sound with a note, instrument and pitch based on form and color of the element (using web audio api?)
- Add indicator when the "center of mass" (average position of all elements) is off-center. The further it is off center, the more pronounced the effect? Tilt the whole thing? Pieces start sliding? Could do something similar for color
- Elements turn into spiders and walk around
- Try adding a tiny amount of vibration (where supported)
- Detect various patterns, reward them on first discovery, like a fullscreen confetti effect (and a counter?)
